<h1 style="text-align: center;">Banana Fusarium Wilt Recognition Based on UAV Multi-spectral Imagery and Automatically Constructed Enhanced Features</h1>

## What is AutoKDFC
Banana Fusarium Wilt (BFW, also known as Panama disease) is a highly infectious and destructive disease that threatens global banana production, requiring early recognition for timely prevention and control. Current monitoring methods primarily rely on continuous variable featuresâ€”such as band reflectances (BRs) and vegetation indices (VIs)â€”collectively referred to as basic features (BFs)â€”which are prone to noise during early infection stages and struggle to capture subtle spectral variations, thus limiting recognition accuracy. To address this limitation, this study proposes a discretized enhanced feature (EF) construction method, the Automated Kernel Density segmentation-based Feature Construction algorithm (AutoKDFC). 

### âœ… **AutoKDFC**: A novel, fully automated feature enhancement algorithm
Transforms noisy continuous reflectance and vegetation indices into discretized binary features using:

(1) Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to model class distributions.

(2) Separability scoring (KDDS) to quantify discriminative power.

(3) Adaptive thresholding for discretizationâ€”no manual tuning needed.

### âœ… **Enhanced Features (EFs)** outperform traditional features

(1) Up to +3% accuracy gain in early-stage BFW detection vs traditional BR/VI inputs.

(2) SVM model with EFs achieved >91% mean accuracy.

### âœ… Practical, scalable disease mapping solution

(1) Combines UAV imagery with AutoKDFC for field-scale Fusarium Wilt monitoring.

(2) Supports real-world application in early intervention and precision agriculture.

## Environment Requirements
All experiments were implemented in Python 3.7 under a Windows 10 environment using the scikit-learn library. For reproducibility, the random_state parameter was set to 42 for both RF and SVM. All other parameters were kept at their default settings. The implementations used were: RF, sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier; SVM, sklearn.svm.SVC; GNB, sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.

## Quick View
You can execute the "AutoKDFC.ipynb" notebook to achieve AutoKDFC.
